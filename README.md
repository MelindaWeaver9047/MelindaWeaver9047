## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a junior engineer currently focused on automating workflows using Bash scripting. This space is where I share scripts, small tools, and experiments aimed at improving efficiency, reducing manual work, and building a stronger foundation in shell scripting and command-line tools.

As I grow in my engineering journey, Iâ€™ve been exploring how simple Bash scripts can solve everyday problemsâ€”whether itâ€™s automating file organization, streamlining deployment processes, monitoring system resources, or managing repetitive tasks. The more I work with Bash, the more I appreciate its power and flexibility for building quick, effective solutions.

This repository is a collection of my learning and experimentation. Youâ€™ll find standalone scripts, mini-projects, and notes where I break down the logic behind each automation. I try to write clear, reusable code with helpful comments to make it easier for others (and future me) to understand and adapt for their own needs.

Iâ€™m also learning to combine Bash with tools like cron, awk, sed, grep, and curl to build more advanced workflows. Whether itâ€™s automating backups, parsing logs, or creating interactive scripts, my goal is to keep building practical tools that solve real problems.

If youâ€™re also getting started with scripting, feel free to explore, use, or improve anything you find here. I welcome feedback, collaboration, and conversationâ€”itâ€™s all part of the learning process.

Thanks for stopping by! I hope the work here helps you in your own automation journey or sparks ideas for simplifying your day-to-day tasks with the command line.
